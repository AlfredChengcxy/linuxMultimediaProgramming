This is an attempt at open sourcing some written notes using github and Creative
Commons. I am collecting all my little text and code snippits from over the years of working with Linux graphics, sound and video into one place and thought I might as well share them in case they are useful to anyone. They are based on about my last 10 years of working as an academic and commercial researcher in pattern multimedia pattern recongition in machine vision, speech recongition, computer music and robotics, and have been used to implement the systems in my research papers (https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=dQ7RURYAAAAJ&hl=en).  As I just finished writing my Springer book "Data Science for Transport" it's easy to reuse the book template, though this is just intended as a loose collection of stuff, not an actual book itself.

The idea is to select only the best of breed of everything and present them together.
It's like a Linux distribution in making these selections. But it is a distribution of ideas
and choices rather than of actual software. (unless we do a Docker as well). As such,
the choice of what to leave out and not cover is also important. The idea is to present a
single, best, toolkit, of tools which work and which also work well with one another as
in a distro.

It is not a detailed tech manual. The purpose is to present the best tools for media
tasks, and to give basic but compilable hello-world examples of code to help get new
project started. I use these code snippets all the time when I need to make small new
projects based on libraries I might not have used for a while and need to remember how
to set them up. After that it's usually easy to consult their big docs on the net to get
details for the specic things I need to do.

Maybe one day this might get big enough to make an actual but fully open-source and
continually updated commuity book as sometimes printed by O'Reilly Community Press
www.oreilly.com/openbook/ or No Starch Press (https://nostarch.com/writeforus).
Continual updating would be really important as like a distro all these tools are constantly
changing.

The plan is to keep it on github where others can fork it and send back pull requests
for incorporation in the main version, both to grow the text and to keep all the software
versions up to date. Github also allows readers to edit the text within the github webpage,
without having to download to their own machine, this is a really quick and easy way to
x things so please if anyone out there happens to be reading this just go ahead, fork,
edit and send a pull request to help keep up to date. If you make useful edits and would
like to add your name to the author list then please ask and I will add it.
